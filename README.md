Tic Tac Toe Android Project
This project is an implementation of the classic game "Tic Tac Toe" for the Android platform. The game allows two players to compete against each other by placing their marks on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to create a sequence of three marks (either X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal.

Features
Two-player mode: Play against a friend on the same device.
Interactive UI: User-friendly interface with touch gestures for placing marks.
Winning detection: Automatically detects when a player wins or if the game ends in a draw.
Play again: Option to restart the game after it concludes.
Score tracking: Keep track of the number of wins for each player.
Prerequisites
To run the Tic Tac Toe Android project, you need to have the following:

Android Studio installed on your machine.
An Android device or emulator with a minimum API level of 19 (Android 4.4 KitKat).
Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.

Wait for Android Studio to sync the project and download any necessary dependencies.
Connect an Android device to your machine or start an emulator.
Click on the "Run" button in Android Studio to build and launch the app on your device/emulator.
Usage
Once the Tic Tac Toe app is running on your Android device/emulator, follow these instructions to play the game:

The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
Two players take turns, one playing as X and the other as O.
To place a mark, tap on an empty cell on the grid.
The game will automatically switch turns after each move.
The first player to create a sequence of three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
To play again, click the "Play Again" button.
